# Void Migration

A python package for simulating the motion of a granular material as a result of the motion of voids. In particular, it (currently) models non-inertial problems quite well. In particular, segregation is well modelled for several systems.

# Installation

1.  Download and unzip (or clone) this repository
2.  Install python 3.11 or newer
3.  Install the required python packages with `pip install -e .`
4.  Set up your pre-commit hooks (so that when you make changes things are kept nice and clean) by running `pre-commit install`
5.  Run the code with `python void_migration/main.py json/collapse.json5`. The parameters for this specific case are stored in `json/collapse.json5`. Change that file name to a different `json5` file to use those values instead.
6.  To use to the GUI version, try `python void_migration/gui.py`. This will open a window where you can set the parameters and run the simulation.
